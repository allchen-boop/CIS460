custom surface deformation shader: I have my object translate diagonally back and forth while inflating into a roundish shape and changing color. I wanted to have my Mario move kinda like those inflatable people in front of car dealerships cause I find them funny hehe 🚶‍♂️

worley worp shader: I utilized two worley noise functions. One is for the background to basically have this effect of moving circular reflections. The other one is to get the noise effect and change the overall color scheme of the scene. I wanted the color theme to look kinda like those thermal temperature things (basically blues, oranges, and greens) 🥵

trippy shader (EC): I offset each color channel differently while having scene move in a wavy motion. It also glows lighter as the waves get more intense. Mimicking the possible effects of being under the influence 😳🤭
